# Muti Page Application Vs Single Page Application

In a traditional Web app (MPA), every time the app calls the server, the server renders a new HTML page. This triggers a page refresh in the browser everytime.

whereas, In an SPA, after the first page loads, all interaction with the server happens through AJAX calls. These AJAX calls return data usually in JSON format. The app uses the JSON data to update the page dynamically, without reloading the full page.

The below figures represents the two approaches.
